#Task Sheet 2
##Task 6 Questions
###Question One:
1. Where would be a good place in the program to keep track of whether the ace is high or not? Remember that the aces' value will be set before a game is started and it will not change for the duration of the game.
2. This should be set as a global variable at the beginning of the program. It should be written in all capitals so that it is clear later on and other programmers that it is a global variable.
###Question Two:
1. Name the function that will need to be altered so that `5. Options` is part of the main menu.
2. The `DisplayMenu()` function.
###Question Three:
1. Name the function that will need to be modified so that card value comparisons will work correctly now that aces can be either high or low.
2. The function is `GetRank(RankNo)`
